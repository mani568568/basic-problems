I.Count the number of islands
Way1: we recursively iterate through and find the number of islands.
Step1:
we try to find the islands possible in every point in the matrix if it 1 i.e. land.
Step2:
once we find the land then search in 4 directions from that land.
Also we mark the land as water to avoid processing it again.
Step3:
if we are able to find the land in any or all the 4 directions,then we do the step 2 again.
