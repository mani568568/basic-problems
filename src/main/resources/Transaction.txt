Transaction::
+++++++++++++

A transaction means a unit of work performed within a database.
A Transaction is often composed of multiple operations.
A transaction is a collection of read and write operations that can either succeed or fail together,as a unit.

ACID Properties:
================

Atomicity:
----------
A transaction should be treated as a single unit of operation, which means either the entire sequence of operations is successful or unsuccessful.

Consistency:
------------
Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another by preventing data corruption.

Isolation:
----------
Intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other concurrent transactions.
Concurrent transactions are effectively serialized.

Durability:
-----------
When a transaction completes, changes are stored in a persistent manner.
Even if there's a power failure or other system errors, the effect of the completed transaction remains.
